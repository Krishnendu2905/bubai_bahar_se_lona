        <h4> Algorithm to write the code inside arduino ide software:</h4>
         Step-1: START <br>
         Step-2: define Pwm pins of motor driver(L298N) as variables(PWM1,PWM2). <br>
         Step-3: define input pins for both the motors as variables(d1,d2,d3,d4).<br>
         Step-4: initialize class HCSR04 and set the trig pin and echo pins of ultrasonic sensor.
         (HCSR04 hc(trig_pin,echo_pin))<br>
         Step-5: take an integer type variable to store the data of the measured distance:<br>
         INSIDE VOID SETUP<br>
         Step-6: begin serial monitor.<br>
         Step-7: set the pin-modes of the used pins which are defined previously.
         All pins must be set in output mode.<br>
         INSIDE VOID LOOP<br>
         Step-8: Use a function hc.dist() and store itâ€™s data to the step-5 variable. <br>
         Step-9: use digitalwrite command to make the d1 pin high, d2 pin low
         And d3 high and d4 low;<br>
         Step-10: take a condition as per your choice to make the car stop within a distance from the obstacle.
         Use digitalwrite to make all the inputpins low inside this condition.<br>
         Step-11: map the value of the step-5 variable between 0 to 255. And store the mapped value inside a variable.<br>
         Step-12: give the mapped value of the previous step to the (PWM1,PWM2 ) pins using analogwrite.<br>
         Step-13:STOP
