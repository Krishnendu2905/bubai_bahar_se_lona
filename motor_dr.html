        <h3>  Motor Driver(L298N): </h3>
      Motor drivers acts as an interface between the motors and the control circuits. Motor require high amount of current whereas the controller circuit works on low current signals. So the function of motor drivers is to take a low-current control signal and then turn it into a higher-current signal that can drive a motor.
      <h4> L298N pin configerations.</h4>
      <h4>Output Pins</h4>
      The L298N motor driver's output channels for the motor A and B are broken out to the edge of the module with two 3.5mm-pitch screw terminals.
        You can connect two DC motors having voltages between 5 to 35V to these terminals. Each channel on the module can deliver up to 2A to the DC motor. However, the amount of current supplied to the motor depends on system's power supply.
    <h4> Control Pins</h4>
        For each of the L298Nâ€™s channels, there are two types of control pins which allow us to control speed and spinning direction of the DC motors at the same time viz. Direction control pins & Speed control pins.
        <h4>Direction Control Pins</h4>
        Using the direction control pins, we can control whether the motor spins forward or backward. These pins actually control the switches of the H-Bridge circuit inside L298N IC.
        The module has two direction control pins for each channel. The IN1 and IN2 pins control the spinning direction of the motor A while IN3 and IN4 control motor B.
        The spinning direction of a motor can be controlled by applying either a logic HIGH(5 Volts) or logic LOW(Ground) to these inputs. The below chart illustrates how this is done.
        <table>
            <th>Input1</th>
            <th>Input2</th>
            <th>Spinning Direction</th>
            <tr>
                <td>Low(0)</td>
                <td>Low(0)</td>
                <td>MotorOFF</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>High(1)</td>
                <td>Low(0)</td>
                <td>Forward</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Low(0)</td>
                <td>High(1)</td>
                <td>Backward</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>High(1)</td>
                <td>High(1)</td>
                <td>MotorOFF</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
       <h4> Speed Control Pins</h4>
        The speed control pins viz. ENA and ENB are used to turn the motors ON, OFF and control its speed.
        Pulling these pins HIGH will make the motors spin, pulling it LOW will make them stop. But, with Pulse Width Modulation (PWM), we can actually control the speed of the motors.
        The module usually comes with a jumper on these pins. When this jumper is in place, the motor is enabled and spins at maximum speed. If you want to control the speed of motors programmatically, you need to remove the jumpers and connect them to PWM-enabled pins on Arduino.

        <h4>GND</h4> is a common ground pin.
        <h4>5V pin</h4> supplies power for the switching logic circuitry inside L298N IC. If the 5V-EN jumper is in place, this pin acts as an output and can be used to power up your Arduino. If the 5V-EN jumper is removed, you need to connect it to the 5V pin on Arduino.
